        Hello my name is Jose Morales. And I am fine just by being called Jose. I am from Guatemala I came here in 2004. And this past summer I finally went back after 13 years of not returning home. That family vacation to Guatemala made me realise a lot and it made me value things a lot more than I would usually would. I want to become a Software Engineering. The reason why I chose that major because everything is becoming more technology and a lot of people are not going to have their jobs in the future due to A.I. taking over the majority of the jobs. My top 5 strengths are caring, creative, motivated, outgoing, and visionary. I have only gone to Guatemala (outside of USA). But inside out of Texas I have gone to Oklahoma and Kansas.

        <p>I feel like a lot people need to know how to manage their money. I have some friends that don’t invest their money and they just waste it. I am a big fan of soccer. My favorite team I Manchester United. They are the best team in the Premier League they have won 20 league titles. I did do some volunteer work for a little bit in high school. My favorite food is the rice and bean that my mom makes. No one makes it like the way she does. I listen to CHH. (Christian Hip-Hop). I am the middle child in the family. My older brother just graduated college. And my sisters is still in high school. I would like to change the world peace. If we have peace in the world that would have a lot of great factors. There would be no more hunger and no more war and hate between people. I have some awards of having all A’s in a semester and also for perfect attendance. I also have certification of Microsoft in Word and Excel. My goals right now are to graduate and to major in Software Engineering. I want to buy my house as soon as I can because I know that they are becoming a lot more expensive as years pass by. After I buy my house I would like to buy another house and rent that one so I can make more money. A businessman told me it is really good to have more than one branch of income.
